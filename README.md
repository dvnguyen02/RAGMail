## Overview

RAGMail is an intelligent email management system that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance email search, summarization, and response generation. It addresses the inefficiency of managing large volumes of emails by leveraging AI to provide contextually relevant information and responses.

# Architecture

RAGMail is built with a modular, scalable architecture:

```

├── processors/         # Email processing and cleaning
├── storage/            # Document and vector stores
├── function/           # Core functionality (search, summarize)
├── tests/              # Testing modules
└── app.py              # Main application entry point
```
