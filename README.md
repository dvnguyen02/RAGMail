### Problem Statement
Managing and searching emails is inefficient, especially for professionals dealing with high email volumes. This project leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to improve email search, summarization, and response generation.

### Solution
- **Email Search** – Find relevant emails using AI-powered retrieval (LLama3.3).
- **Summarization** – Generate summaries of many email threads.
- **Automated Responses** – Suggest context-aware replies if ever need to.
