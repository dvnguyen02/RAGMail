  "Body": "Kia ora Ngoc,\r\nThank you for applying to the Alumni as Mentors programme. For your application to be accepted, you are also required to complete mentee training. If you have already signed up to a training session, please disregard this email.\r\nThe one-hour mentee training sessions are aimed at helping mentees get the best out of programme and succeed in their mentoring partnerships. In the session, we will discuss how to find the right mentor, how to be an effective mentee, share tips on how to build a strong relationship with your mentor, and clarify our expectations of you and mentors.\r\nWe have scheduled more training sessions<https://careerhub.vuw.ac.nz/students/events?eventTypeIds=1&page=1&studentSiteId=1> this week and early next week, so make sure you sign up and attend a session on time. Several students have already matched with their mentors of choice, and the earlier you complete training and get access to the mentoring platform, the better your chances of finding your preferred mentor before another student does.\r\nIf you have any questions about the training, the programme or your application, or if you are unable to make any of the already scheduled sessions, please email us and we will try to schedule additional sessions that might work better.\r\nKind regards,\r\nAnna\r\n\r\nAnna Greenhow\r\nThe Alumni as Mentors programme team\r\nWellington Careers and Employment\r\nTe Herenga Waka-Victoria University of Wellington\r\nwww.wgtn.ac.nz/careers<http://www.wgtn.ac.nz/careers>\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DB8DCB.E6675210]<http://www.wgtn.ac.nz/>\r\nPlease consider the environment before printing this email.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
